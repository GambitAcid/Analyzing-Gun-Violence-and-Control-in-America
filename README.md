# Gun-Violence-and-Control-in-America
"Gun violence feels too big, too powerful to stop. But it’s not too big for you to take some real, meaningful actions. You control what you decide you can live with, and what you can't. You can choose whether you do something, or do nothing."
— Jennifer Rosen Heinz



## Project overview

Considering recent events, we endeavored to take a closer look at gun violence in America. Our hope was to identify trends which if we are lucky might point to some root causes though a look at commonality among incidents. 
We hope our research can help others find a path that will lead to a solution. 


## Technical Overview

We collected available data from a variety of public and private sources, including the CDC, Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) and gunviolence.org, bringing them togoether in a single postgres database GunData.
